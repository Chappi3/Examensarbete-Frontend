        QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first
        designed in 1994 for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about
        the item to which it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a
        website or application. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to store
        data efficiently; extensions may also be used. The Quick Response system became popular outside the automotive industry due to its
        fast readability and greater storage capacity compared to standard UPC barcodes. Applications include product tracking, item
        identification, time tracking, document management, and general marketing. A QR code consists of black squares arranged in a square
        grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera, and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon error
        correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data is then extracted from patterns that are present in
        both horizontal and vertical components of the image.
